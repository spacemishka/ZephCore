/* ===== Universal two-clock beat entropy ==================================
 *
 * One physical entropy source for every board: count CPU cycles elapsed across
 * a fixed interval of an INDEPENDENT low-frequency oscillator. The two clocks
 * come from different sources, so the count fluctuates with the slow
 * oscillator's phase noise — real physical entropy, not the deterministic
 * same-domain loop that CPU-jitter degenerates to where the cycle counter and
 * CPU share a clock (measured dead on ESP32: thousands of identical deltas).
 *
 * FAST counter = timing_counter_get() — portable CPU cycle counter (DWT on
 *   Cortex-M, CCOUNT on Xtensa; both at CPU frequency). Needs
 *   CONFIG_TIMING_FUNCTIONS and a one-time timing_init()/timing_start().
 *
 * SLOW clock = an oscillator in a DIFFERENT domain from the CPU, selected by a
 *   principled rule so the choice is coherent across boards:
 *     - ESP32: the RTC-slow oscillator via esp_rtc_get_time_us() (internal
 *       ~136 kHz RC, independent of the XTAL->PLL CPU path).
 *     - Any board whose Zephyr system timer runs < 1 MHz: that timer IS a
 *       low-frequency oscillator cross-domain from the CPU (e.g. nRF's
 *       32.768 kHz RTC off LFXO/LFRC), so k_cycle_get_32() is a valid slow
 *       clock. REQUIRES the LF clock to be LFXO/LFRC, not synthesised from
 *       HFCLK — true for every BLE-capable nRF config; the health check below
 *       catches it if a board ever violates that.
 *     - Otherwise (system timer at CPU frequency, e.g. bare SysTick): no
 *       independent slow clock is identified and the timing stages are
 *       SKIPPED — a same-domain counter measures a deterministic loop
 *       (~0 bits, measured), so sampling it would only pretend to add
 *       entropy. Such boards (STM32WL SysTick, nRF54L 1 MHz GRTC) rely on
 *       their true TRNG via the CSPRNG stages, which is what the removed
 *       CPU-jitter fallback effectively did anyway.
 *
 * Window = 500 us, from an on-hardware ESP32 sweep (memory/findings.md):
 * 120/250/500/1000 us gave 1.85/3.04/3.81/5.14 bits/sample; 500 us is the knee.
 * Full 32-bit delta is mixed. On ESP32 this is a SECONDARY source (the
 * bootloader_random-seeded HWRNG is primary); on nRF it is the strong
 * non-HWRNG leg.
 *
 * CAVEAT (memory/findings.md): the health stats show the beat VARIES, not that
 * it is random — the selftest output-diversity run is what validates it. */

/* ===== Entropy extraction via AES-256-CTR ================================
 *
 * Per crypto consultant (MeshCore upstream PR#2280 author): the

 * truncated hash. For our 32-byte Ed25519-seed output the difference
 * is design hygiene rather than security, but the cost is the same
 * order of magnitude (~one SHA-512 vs SHA-256 + two AES-ECB blocks).
 *
 * Construction (NIST SP 800-108 KDF-in-Counter-Mode style):
 *   1. Extract: SHA-256(pool) → 32-byte AES-256 key.
 *   2. Expand:  AES-256-ECB(counter_i) for counter_i = 0, 1, 2 ...
 *               output = concatenation of ciphertext blocks.
 * Plaintext-XOR (true CTR mode) is omitted because plaintext would be
 * all-zero — we want just the keystream.
 *
 * Uses PSA crypto API (already enabled via PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_AES +
 * PSA_WANT_ALG_ECB_NO_PADDING in zephcore_common.conf).
 *
 * Every failure path fills `err` with the failing step and the raw
 * psa_status_t.  Failure here is a panic-reboot loop the user sees as a
 * dead board (GH #88 on ttgo_tbeam), and the status code is the only
 * thing that says WHICH step failed — a bare "extraction failed" costs a
 * round trip to the reporter for a build that prints it.  Sized for the
 * caller's stack buffer; truncation is harmless.
