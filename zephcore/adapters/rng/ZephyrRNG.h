	 *   4. Hardware-timing entropy       — two-clock beat (ESP32 RTC-slow,

	 *   6. Hardware-timing entropy #2    — independent window
	 * Conditioned via AES-256-CTR (SHA-256(pool) → key, ECB on counter).
	 * On ESP32 the primary source is the bootloader_random-seeded HWRNG
	 * (stages 1+5); the beat (4+6) is a physical second source. On nRF the
	 * CSPRNG and the beat are both independently strong. Health-checked;
	 * reboots on degenerate output. Blocks ~450ms — first-boot identity only.
	 *
	 * Output is suitable as an Ed25519 seed regardless of platform
	 * TRNG state at boot. */
