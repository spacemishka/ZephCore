/**
 * @brief Transfer a Patch RAM (PRAM) into the chip
 *
 * This function is a helper function that execute several calls to @ref lr20xx_regmem_write_regmem32 in order to
 * transfer the complete PRAM.
 * After loading the PRAM with @ref lr20xx_patch_load_pram, it must be enabled by calling @ref lr20xx_patch_enable_pram.
 *
 * @note The helper functions @ref lr20xx_pram_load_pram_lr2021 and @ref lr20xx_pram_load_pram_lr20x2 handle the load
 * and enabling of the appropriate PRAM.
 *
 * @param context Chip implementation context
 * @param address The base address in the chip memory where the PRAM is to be written
 * @param buffer Pointer to the buffer being the PRAM data to transfer. It is up to the caller to ensure it contains at
 * least @p length elements
 * @param length Number of elements fro @p buffer array to write
 *
 * @return lr20xx_status_t Operation status
 *
 * @see lr20xx_patch_enable_pram, lr20xx_regmem_write_regmem32, lr20xx_patch_get_version
