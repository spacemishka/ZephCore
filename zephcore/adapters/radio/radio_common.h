/* --- RSSI read timing (SX1261/2 DS rev 2.2 Table 13-82) ---
 *
 * The median-of-N above only rejects outliers if the N reads are actually
 * independent.  The chip updates RSSI once per "averaging window"; reads
 * issued faster than that return the same underlying sample repeatedly, and
 * the median degenerates into one read with extra SPI traffic.
 *
 * The published table is indexed by GFSK channel-filter bandwidth.  Across
 * all 19 rows the product window_us * BW_kHz lands in 921..938, so
 * 936 / BW_kHz reproduces every published value to within a microsecond.
 * The separate "RSSI delay" column (BUSY falling edge -> first valid sample)
 * is 12x to 15x the window across the same rows.
 *
 * CAVEAT: Semtech documents this for GFSK only and publishes no LoRa
 * equivalent.  The RSSI path is the same analog/AGC chain, so these are used
 * as the best available proxy — not as specified LoRa figures.  `get cad`
 * reports the measured burst spread so the assumption stays falsifiable on
 * real hardware.

/* Burst-stat rescale point.  The counters behind `get cad`'s sp field are
 * halved (all three together, so the mean and the zero-spread share are
 * preserved exactly) once the burst count reaches this.
 *
 * Two reasons, and the display one is the hard constraint: the remote CLI
 * reply is capped at CLI_REMOTE_REPLY_SIZE (161 B) and has to fit the header
 * plus three level lines, so no field may grow without bound.  At one burst
 * per 15 s a free-running counter passes 500 000 in three months and would
 * eat the level rows.  8192 keeps it to four digits forever.
 *
 * The second reason is that halving turns the totals into an exponential
 * forgetting window, so the numbers describe recent conditions instead of
 * being anchored to whatever the channel was doing at boot.  Same idea as
 * CAD_STATS_DECAY_MS below, which halves the CAD counters on a timer. */
