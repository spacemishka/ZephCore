 *
 * It lives here because these ranges were previously copy-pasted into six
 * places and drifted. That drift was not theoretical: when 2.4 GHz support
 * landed, the setters were widened and the *loaders* were not, so a node
 * accepted `set freq 2450`, saved it, and then silently reverted to factory
 * defaults on the next boot because the load-time guard still capped at
 * 960 MHz. A setter must never accept what the loader will throw away.
 *
 * FREQ spans both LR2021 RF paths — the sub-GHz one (150-960 MHz) and the
 * high band (1.9-2.5 GHz). Boards whose radio cannot reach the high band are
 * limited by their own driver, not by this range.
 *
 * BW_MAX is the one value that is per-build. Only the LR2021 implements the
 * wide 203/406/812/1000 kHz set; every other driver here maps an unknown
 * bandwidth to 125 kHz instead of refusing it, so accepting 812 on those
 * boards would put a node on a channel width it never reported. */
