# ZephCore 1.17.4-zephcore

*Re-release: rebuilt to pick up the transmit-airtime fix listed at the end.*

Storage housekeeping, plus a listen-before-talk fix. The repeater's `erase` never actually erased,
a node flashed from another firmware could start out with somebody else's leftovers underneath it,
and switching a node between companion and repeater firmware quietly let the two share the same
128 KB. Separately, the channel-activity detector was using the wrong reference table on LR1110
boards, the companion's built-in `v` contact carried an unusable key on about half of all nodes, and
a node that decided the channel was busy could stop transmitting and never start again.

## `erase` now erases

On a repeater or room server, `erase` promised to format the entire filesystem. It deleted the files
in its own folder and cleared the phone pairings, and left everything else where it was.

That only mattered when a node was unhealthy — which is precisely when somebody reaches for `erase`.
If anything had written into the storage area from outside, deleting our own files could not undo it,
and the command reported success while the problem stayed.

`erase` now wipes the storage area, the phone-pairing store, and external flash where a board has it,
then reboots. The node comes back exactly like one out of the box.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is a genuine factory reset now, and it takes the identity with it.** Anyone who had your node
> in their contacts will need to add it again, and the admin password, ACL and region map go too.

The companion's `erase` already worked this way. Repeater, room server and observer now share its
implementation, so there is one behaviour to remember instead of two.

---

## Switching a node between roles now wipes it

Companion and repeater firmware keep their files in separate folders, and until now each left the
other's alone. Flashing back and forth preserved both sets.

That sounds generous and was not. The two roles share a single 128 KB storage area, so a companion's
few hundred contacts and full advert cache leave noticeably less room for a repeater's region map and
access list — and a write that no longer fits simply fails. Nothing is corrupted; the node just runs
out of space for reasons its owner cannot see, because half of what is stored belongs to firmware that
is not running.

From 1.17.4 each role checks on first boot whether the storage belongs to it, and formats everything
if not.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Export your identity before switching roles.** Identity, settings, contacts, channels, access list,
> region map and phone pairings all go. There is no undo and no prompt — the first boot on the new
> firmware has already done it by the time you see anything.

> [!NOTE]
> **Repeater, room server and observer still share.** Those three keep their files in the same place
> and use the same settings layout, so moving between them keeps identity and configuration. It is the
> companion that is now separate.

## A node coming from other firmware starts clean

Nothing about installing firmware erases storage. Dragging a UF2 writes the program and nothing else,
and each firmware only clears the piece of flash it believes is its own. On the nRF52840 boards,
Arduino MeshCore's storage sits inside the region ZephCore uses, so whichever boots first tidies its
own corner and leaves the rest. On one Seeed Solar Node that produced a repeater which came up looking
perfectly healthy and silently refused to forward anything, because a single setting deep inside its
configuration had been overwritten by another firmware's bytes.

Each role now checks on first boot whether the storage is its own and, if not, clears the whole lot
before writing anything.

> **Moving between Arduino MeshCore and ZephCore still needs an erase in both directions.** ZephCore

## Listen-before-talk was too cautious on LR1110 boards

Before transmitting, a node listens for a LoRa signal already on the air. How faint a signal counts is
set by a per-chip threshold, and ZephCore tunes it automatically from what each node measures.

The starting values for that tuning came from a reference table — and on the LR1110 it was the wrong
table, copied from a different Semtech chip and read at the wrong setting. It started roughly five
steps too insensitive, so those nodes spent weeks walking the threshold down and still hit the limit of
how far they were allowed to adjust. Two nodes sitting in one room made it visible: an SX1262 settled
one step from its starting point while the LR1110s next to it were pinned at the end of their range.

The tables now come from Semtech's own reference code, and they take **bandwidth** into account, which
nothing did before. That barely moves the SX1262 — a count or two, and nothing at all at the default
preset — but on the LR1110 bandwidth is worth around twelve counts per doubling, which is most of the
error. The range each node may adjust within is wider, and the radio now tells the tuner where its own
limits are, so a node can no longer sit against a wall it cannot see.

Affected boards: **T1000-E**, **ThinkNode M3** and **ThinkNode M9**. On SX1262 boards nothing changes
unless you run a 250 or 500 kHz bandwidth, where the old value was up to ten counts too sensitive.

How the tuner judges each measurement has changed too. It used to poll the radio a few times after a
detection and infer whether anything had really been there; now the radio stays listening and reports
whether a packet actually followed, so each reading is an observation rather than a guess. Nothing to
configure — it just means the figures behind `get cad.stats` describe what they claim to.

> [!NOTE]
> **Run `set cad.reset` after upgrading.** The tuning statistics your node collected are measured

## A node that believed the channel was busy could stop transmitting for good

Before each transmission a node listens, and defers if it hears anything. If that kept happening it
was supposed to give up after four seconds and send anyway — a safeguard for a radio stuck reporting
activity that is not there. A refactor turned that into "wait, then try again", and the give-up was
lost.

A node in that state refuses every transmission indefinitely, queues what it cannot send, and
eventually starts discarding packets — all while looking perfectly idle, because the refusals were
logged at a level nobody runs. Reproduced on the bench: a node in that state sent **nothing at all in
twenty seconds**, then flushed thirty queued messages the moment the cause was removed.

The four-second safeguard is back, and a refused transmission is now reported in the log instead of
being invisible.

> [!NOTE]
> **Only the "the radio may be stuck" case forces a transmission.** If the listen genuinely reports a
> busy channel the node still waits — transmitting over traffic it can hear would cause exactly the
> collision the check exists to avoid.

### A node set too sensitive can now find its own way back

The safeguard above rescues a transmission that is already queued. It does not help the case where the
listening threshold itself is set so sensitive that the node can never clear the channel at all — which
`set cad.auto off` makes possible, and which nothing used to undo. A node in that state still receives,
and still accepts a command telling it to fix itself, but cannot transmit the reply. In practice no
ordinary app can complete the login it is waiting on, so a repeater on a mast is simply unreachable.

Two layers now recover from it.

The first watches for a node that has traffic to send and has been refused for a full minute. It relaxes
the threshold one step regardless of whether automatic tuning is switched on, and repeats until something
gets out. On the bench, a node parked at the most sensitive setting with every other recovery path
deliberately disabled went from completely silent to transmitting in five minutes.

The second does not wait for traffic, because a node with nothing queued would otherwise wait up to two
days for its next scheduled advert to reveal the problem. It reads the measurements the node already
collects and steps the threshold back when the current setting reports the channel busy on essentially
every check — the signature of a detector that cannot clear, rather than a channel that is genuinely
occupied. On the bench it walked a node from the most sensitive setting back to a working one in about
half an hour, with nothing queued to send at any point.

Both write the new threshold to flash, so a node that heals itself stays healed across a reboot. Both
stop as soon as the evidence stops — neither runs to the end of the range.

> [!NOTE]
> **This means `get cad.offset` can read something you did not set.** That is the point: it records a
> node that recovered itself. If you find a node away from where you left it, its threshold was refusing
> every transmission at the old value.

## The built-in `v` contact had an unusable key on half of all nodes

Every companion offers a contact named after itself with a `v` in front — the loopback chat that runs
the console commands. Its key was built in a way that produced something key-shaped but, on roughly
half of all nodes, not a valid key for the curve the protocol uses.

The official app never checked and so never minded. Other clients do check, and refused either to add
the contact or to send it a message. That is why the v-contact has worked for some people and not for
others with no apparent pattern: it was a coin flip settled when the node's identity was created, and
nothing the owner did afterwards could change the outcome.

The key is now derived properly and is valid on every node. Nothing else about the v-contact moves —
it is still local to the app, still never touches the radio, and still has no private key stored
anywhere.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The v-contact's key changes with this release, so your app may keep showing the old one too.** Delete
> the leftover `v<name>` entry by hand. The new one arrives on its own the next time the app connects.

---

## Two console commands did not do what they said

**`set cad.reset` left the threshold where it was.** It cleared the tuning statistics and nothing
else, so a node that had spent weeks walking its listen-before-talk threshold away from the starting
point stayed exactly there — now with no measurements to explain why. That is the opposite of a
reset, and it matters most in this release, where the whole point of the command is to let an LR1110
node leave the position the old reference table pushed it into. It now clears the statistics *and*
returns the threshold to the starting point, applying it to the radio immediately.

**`set probe.interval default` switched probing off.** The console read the word `default` as the
number zero, and zero is a legal value for that setting meaning "stop probing" — so the node did
exactly that and answered `OK`. Any typo did the same. The same flaw sat in `set cad.busycap`, where
zero means "no airtime cap".

Both are fixed, and the fix is general: **every `set` that takes a number or an on/off value now
accepts the word `default`** and restores that setting to what a factory-fresh node uses. `set radio
default` puts all four radio parameters back together. Input that is neither a number nor `default`
is now rejected with an error instead of being quietly read as zero.

> [!NOTE]
> **Worth checking `get probe.interval` and `get cad.busycap` on nodes you have configured by hand.**
> If either reads `0` and you did not intend to switch it off, a mistyped value is the likely cause.
> `set probe.interval default` and `set cad.busycap default` now genuinely restore them.

---

## Two settings did not behave the way they were documented

**`set backoff.multiplier 0` did not survive a reboot.** Zero is the documented way
to switch reactive backoff off, and it worked until the node restarted — at which
point a migration meant for old settings files could not tell "never configured"
from "deliberately zero", and put it back to 0.2. Anyone who believed they had
disabled reactive backoff has in fact been running with it on the whole time. Zero
now means zero, and a genuinely absent setting still arrives as 0.2.

## The LEDs are yours now

Until now the node's LEDs were all-or-nothing: `set leds off` killed every one of them, and that was the
only choice on offer. Two new settings sit underneath that master switch and say *what* each LED reacts to.

**`set leds.radio <tx|rx|all|off>`** — the LoRa activity LED.

- `tx` — lit for the duration of each transmit. This is what it has always done, and stays the default.
- `rx` — a short blink for each packet received.
- `all` — both.
- `off` — dark.

`rx` is the interesting one. It turns the node into a passive activity monitor: you can see at a glance
whether a repeater is hearing anything at all, which is otherwise a question you can only answer by
plugging into the console. The blink fires on valid packets only, so it means "a real packet landed" and
not "there was noise on the channel".

**`set leds.hb <hb|unread|all|off>`** — the heartbeat LED.

- `all` — the 4-second liveness tick, widening from a 20 ms flicker to a 200 ms pulse while you have unread
  messages. Unchanged, and still the default.
- `hb` — liveness only. Never widens, never signals unread.
- `unread` — the reverse: dark until something is waiting for you, then the long pulse. A quiet node that
  only speaks up when it has something to say.
- `off` — dark.

Both are applied the moment you set them and survive a reboot. `set leds off` still overrides both, so if
you have a node you want dark, one command is still all it takes.

> [!NOTE]
> **Upgrading changes nothing.** Both settings default to exactly what your node does today, so an upgrade
> looks identical until you change something.

### What your board can actually do

This depends on how many LEDs the board has, and it varies more than you might expect.

Six boards — RAK4631, SenseCAP Solar, ThinkNode M1 and M6, LilyGo T-Echo and XIAO nRF52840 — wire the
heartbeat and the radio to different LEDs, so the two settings are completely independent. The XIAO has a
third for unread messages.

Eight boards — Heltec T114, T096 and Wireless Tracker v2, TTGO T-Beam, GAT562, RAK3401, RAK WisMesh Tag and
LilyGo T-Impulse Plus — drive both from a **single** LED. They still work, and radio activity now takes
priority so a transmit is no longer cut short by the heartbeat's timer firing underneath it. But one LED
showing two things is hard to read, so `set leds.hb off` is worth considering there.

Twenty boards have no radio LED at all, including the Wio Tracker L1, T1000-E, MeshTracker X1 and the
Heltec V3/V4/V43 family. `set leds.radio` is still accepted and remembered — so the setting follows your
node if you move it to hardware that does have one — but it does nothing, and the reply tells you so.

> [!NOTE]
> **`unread` needs a companion with buttons.** The unread count only exists in the button UI. On repeaters,
> observers and joystick-UI boards it is permanently zero, which means `leds.hb unread` leaves the LED dark
> for good and `leds.hb all` behaves the same as `hb`. Use `hb` or `off` on those.

---

## A repeater told to turn its LEDs off turned them back on

On a repeater or room server, `set leds off` worked — until the next reboot, when the LEDs started blinking
again. `get leds` still answered `off`, so the node insisted it was doing what you asked while visibly not
doing it, and the only fix was to issue `set leds off` a second time.

The setting was being applied about forty lines before the saved settings were read from flash, so it was
always acting on the factory default rather than on yours. The stored value was never wrong and never lost;
it just arrived too late to be used.

This is why it looked intermittent rather than broken: it took a reboot to show up, and a solar-powered node
picks its own moments to reboot. Companions and observers were never affected.

## Also in this release (via west update, upstream sync or manually added)

- **ESP32-S3 companions now connect over USB.** Heltec V4 and V43, Wireless Tracker v2, XIAO S3,
  Station G2 and T3-S3 speak the companion protocol over their native USB port by default. Repeater,
  room server, observer and debug builds keep that port as a console. One catch: esptool's automatic
  reset into download mode no longer works on those boards — use `start dfu`, a 1200-baud touch, or
  the BOOT button.
- **The clock can follow your timezone.** `set tz.offset <-12..14>` shifts the on-device clock by whole
  hours and the screen names the zone it is showing (`UTC+2`). Works on companions and repeaters with a
  display. Display only, by design: the node's own clock, the `clock` and `time` commands and everything
  on the air stay UTC, so timestamps and your app are unaffected.
- **Telemetry read 0 mA on any discharging node.** Voltage and current are signed in CayenneLPP and we
  encoded them unsigned, so a negative reading saturated to zero. Boards with a bidirectional power
  monitor now report discharge properly.
- **`region load` could strand the console.** Only a blank line ended it, and the USB reader discards
  blank lines — so the repeater CLI was stuck until a reboot. Any unindented command now aborts the
  load and then runs.
- **New board: Meshnology W12.** It ships at 5 dBm with a 13 dBm ceiling: bench measurements on the
  finished board put the saturation point of its 1 W front end well above the 4 dBm the port was
  originally built around, so the earlier figure would have left it several dB down.
- **`get cad.auto`, `get cad.offset` and `get cad.busycap`** can be read on their own, instead of only
  inside `get cad.stats`.
- **A wasted erase on the companion.** Running `erase` from the companion's USB console formatted the
  storage, then formatted it again on the reboot that followed, because the marker saying "this node
  has been set up" went out with everything else. Both paths behave the same way now.
- **Transmit airtime read far too high, and drained the duty-cycle budget with it.** It was timed as
  wall clock around each send, so channel checks and radio housekeeping counted as airtime — eight
  times over on one repeater. It is now the packet's own airtime, the same figure received airtime has
  always used, and the "packets sent" total can no longer disagree with the flood and direct counts
  beneath it.
- **Nodes logged filesystem errors that were not errors.** Routine checks for files that simply do not
  exist yet — a leftover temporary file, a contacts list on a node that has never stored a contact —
  were reported as failures by the layer underneath, one on every settings save on a repeater and four
  on every boot on a companion. Nothing was wrong and nothing was lost, but a genuine storage fault had
  to be spotted among them. The checks now look before they act, and a healthy node boots with a clean
  log.
